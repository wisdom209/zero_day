## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/html-tutorial-exercises-course) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-tutorial-exercises-course.git).

> Once you have VSCode open the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Manual installation

Clone the repository in your local environment and follow the steps below:

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```sh
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-html
```

2. Download these particular exercises using learnpack and `cd` into the folder:

```sh
$ learnpack download html-tutorial-exercises-course
$ cd html-tutorial-exercises-course
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find an "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```sh
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```

<!-- endhide -->

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **index.js:** represents the entry file for the entire app.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
